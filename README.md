# Doggobase - The Dog Name Finder :dog:

The goal of this React application is to collect common Hungarian dog names and create a database with images and personality traits. This way users can search for names based on given characteristics such as gender, size, etc. or simply browse names. 

Logged in users can also add dogs with pictures and save their favourite dogs.

The backend was created with Node.js and data is stored in Cloud Firestore (data of dogs and user data with encrypted passwords). Images uploaded by users are stored in Cloudinary.

Backend repository: https://github.com/RekaVadasz/dog-name-finder-BE
